This script calculates the symmetric SNP differences between two groups of genomes. The output consists of the minimum, mean and maximum as well as a dataframe of all pairwise symmetric SNP differences. The input file "annotated_variants.tab" can be generated using the perSVade pipeline
The script can also compare two individual genomes or 1 genome vs a group of genomes

It is recommended that each "annotated_variants.tab" file is stored in a directory named after the genome.
